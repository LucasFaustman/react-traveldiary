# Travel Diary Created with React Using Props

This project is my second React app bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

You will first need to install NPM modules by running npm install.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Alternatively, the app can be hosted on http://localhost:3000 via Node and Express. You first need to run 

### 'npm install express --save'

Then you can run the app via node server/server.js in the root file.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: Express, Node, React, Javascript.

The focus for this project was to make implement props to create cards instead of my travel diary, rather than hard coding elements.

## Optimizations

This is my first project using props and it was a simple travel diary, so there was no need for a database. However, in the future, I would log my data to a database rather than having a data file inside of my app.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest challenge for this project was using props for the first time to cut down on redundant code. I learned how to use props to create dry, easy to reuse code that I don't need to constantly be updating.
